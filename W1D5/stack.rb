# ## Exercise 1 - Stack
#
# Let's write a `Stack` class. To do this, use the following framework:
#
# ```ruby
#   class Stack
#     def initialize
#       # create ivar to store stack here!
#     end
#
#     def push(el)
#       # adds an element to the stack
#     end
#
#     def pop
#       # removes one element from the stack
#     end
#
#     def peek
#       # returns, but doesn't remove, the top element in the stack
#     end
#   end
# ```
#
# To test that your code works, create a new instance of the Stack class, and play around with adding and removing elements. Remember, a stack follows the principle of LIFO!
